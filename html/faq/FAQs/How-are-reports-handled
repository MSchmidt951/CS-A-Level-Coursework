A user of the site can report a game if they find it is offensive, does not work or they have a complaint about it. They can do this by going on to the page where the game is, press the report button and enter a reason.
This will automatically send an email to the administrators with which game was reported and the reason for the report. Then the admins will decide what action to take based off of what the reports say and whether they think they will need to take action.
