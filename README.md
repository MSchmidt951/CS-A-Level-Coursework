# CS-A-Level-Coursework

The source code for my 2019-2020 Computer Science A-Level coursework.  
This is a website called 'Game Bloc' which users can upload, download and play games on.

## Installation

It is run on Linux (tested on Raspbian 9) and requires PHP (tested on v7.4.4) and Apache (tested on v2.4.45) to be installed.

The `html` folder is to be put in `/var/www`.  
The location of the `gameBloc` folder does not matter.

To start the server run `gameBloc/serverScripts/start.sh`.  
To stop the server run `gameBloc/serverScripts/stop.sh`.
